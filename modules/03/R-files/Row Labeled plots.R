# When we read the company names in the row-labeled dot plot
# we may notice they are in descending alphabetical order
# from top to bottom.
#
# Alphabetic order may be good for finding a company names
# but people are often interested in the rank order of the
# companies based on a variable such as the one-year percent
# change.

# The reorder() function provides simple way
# to control the row plotting order so that
# the company with the largest percent
# change in yearly value appears at the top.
#
# The second argument of reorder() specifies tibble
# variable that we want to control the Company order
# on the y-axis.  In table terminology y-axis order is
# the row order.  In table terminology rows are numbered
# top down.  The graph y-axis convention the number increase
# from bottom to top. Convention conflicts can be bothersome
# and be behind communication problems.

# We can use -Yearly reverse the company plotting order.

# 3.2 Reversing the sort order
